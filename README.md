=========================

## Description

Simple [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/ "AutoHotkey web site") scripts that will perform some actions by using the mouse.

I made these scripts for myself to be able to play some games in a tablet which lacks of a physical keyboard but has a mouse attached. This way I can exit the games, show their menus, show an on-screen keyboard (which does not work well with some games when they are running in full-screen mode, sadly), etc. by just using the mouse.

Hopefully, they could also be useful for someone else so I decided to share them.


## Included scripts

**pressEsc** - It will press the "ESC" (_ESCAPE_) key when the mouse wheel button (the middle button) is pressed.

**pressF5** - It will press the "F5" key when the mouse wheel button (the middle button) is pressed.

**pressF10** - It will press the "F10" key when the mouse wheel button (the middle button) is pressed.

**showOSK** - It will show the "OSK" (_osk.exe_) which belongs to the "On Screen Keyboard" ("floating" around the screen, as an independent window) when the mouse wheel button (the middle button) is pressed.

**showTabTip** - It will show the "TabTip" (_tabtip.exe_) which also belongs to an on-screen keyboad (the one attached to the bottom of the screen) when the mouse wheel button (the middle button) is pressed.


## How to run

To use the already-compiled binaries, just run them as any other normal program. While they are running, an icon will be shown in the taskbar.

Note that, if desired, more than one script can be run at the same time to be combined.


## Compile from the source code

Apart from the binaries for Microsoft Windows (32-bit, also compatible with 64-bit Windows), the source code is included so they can be easily modified to edit the actions performed, enhance features, etc.

To compile from the source code, the [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/ "AutoHotkey web site") software will be needed.
